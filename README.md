When properly configured, the mod automatically translates messages:

```

[Chat for you]: hello

Player2: hello

```

> The original message text is available when hovering over the translated message!

## üñ•Ô∏è System Requirements

- Minecraft 1.21.4
- Fabric Loader 0.16.10 or newer
- Java 17 or higher
- Internet connection for translation services
- DeepL API key (optional, only if you use DeepL)

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you encounter problems with the mod, check the following points:

1. If translation doesn't work:
   - [ ] Check your internet connection
   - [ ] Make sure your DeepL API key is correct (if using DeepL)
   - [ ] Check game logs for error messages

2. If messages aren't being translated:
   - [ ] Make sure language codes in the configuration file are set correctly
   - [ ] Verify that the translation service is properly configured
   - [ ] Check that the translation direction is set correctly

3. DeepL API problems:
   - [ ] In settings, use `"defaultSourceLang": "auto"` for language auto-detection
   - [ ] Check that your API key is valid and hasn't expired
   - [ ] Be aware of the limitations of the free DeepL plan

> [!WARNING]
> When using older versions of the DeepL API, errors may occur with the `source_lang` parameter when set to "auto". We recommend updating to the latest version of the mod.

### Log Checking

Check logs for messages:
- `!!! MIXIN ChatHudMixin LOADED !!!` - confirms that the mixin is loaded
- `Converting language for DeepL` - tracks language code conversion
- `DeepL translation: ... -> ...` - confirms successful translation via DeepL

### Resolved Issues:

- Fixed an issue with DeepL API where the `source_lang` parameter with "auto" value caused an error
- Updated DeepL API library to version 1.9.0
- Improved error handling and logging
- Added additional language aliases for more convenient use

## üì¢ Support
